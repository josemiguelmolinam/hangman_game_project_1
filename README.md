#  Hangman Game

The Hangman Game is a classic guessing game where you have to guess a hidden word letter by letter before the drawing of a hanged person is completed.

## How to play:

Enter a letter in the text field and press the "Check" button.
If the entered letter is present in the hidden word, it will be shown in its corresponding position in the word. If not, you will lose a try.
Continue entering letters until you guess the complete word or until all the tries are exhausted.
If you guess the word before using up all the tries, you win the game. If not, you lose the game.

Have fun playing Hangman!
